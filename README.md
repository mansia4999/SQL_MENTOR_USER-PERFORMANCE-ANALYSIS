# SQL_MENTOR_USER-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS
## THIS PROJECT IS  FOR OVERVIEW OF THE SQL  COMMANDS FOR BEGINNERS

# Project Overview
This project is designed to help beginners understand SQL querying and performance analysis using real-time data from SQL Mentor datasets. In this project, you will analyze user performance by creating and querying a table of user submissions. The goal is to solve a series of SQL problems to extract meaningful insights from user data.

## Objectives
Learn how to use SQL for data analysis tasks such as aggregation, filtering, and ranking.
Understand how to calculate and manipulate data in a real-world dataset.
Gain hands-on experience with SQL functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, EXTRACT(), and DENSE_RANK().
Develop skills for performance analysis using SQL by solving different types of data problems related to user performance.

## Project Level: Beginner
This project is designed for beginners who are familiar with the basics of SQL and want to learn how to handle real-world data analysis problems. You'll be working with a small dataset and writing SQL queries to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.

## SQL Mentor User Performance Dataset
The dataset consists of information about user submissions for an online learning platform. Each submission includes:

**User ID**

**Question ID**

**Points Earned**

**Submission Timestamp**

**Username**

This data allows you to analyze user performance in terms of correct and incorrect submissions, total points earned, and daily/weekly activity.

## SQL Problems and Questions
Here are the SQL problems that you will solve as part of this project:
## Q1. List All Distinct Users and Their Stats
**Description:** Return the user name, total submissions, and total points earned by each user.

**Expected Output:** A list of users with their submission count and total points.

 ## Q2. Calculate the Daily Average Points for Each User
 **Description:** For each day, calculate the average points earned by each user.
 
**Expected Output:** A report showing the average points per user for each day.

 ## Q3. Find the Top 3 Users with the Most Correct Submissions for Each Day
**Description:** Identify the top 3 users with the most correct submissions for each day.

**Expected Output:** A list of users and their correct submissions, ranked daily.

## Q4. Find the Top 5 Users with the Highest Number of Incorrect Submissions
**Description:** Identify the top 5 users with the highest number of incorrect submissions.

**Expected Output:** A list of users with the count of incorrect submissions.

 ## Q5. Find the Top 10 Performers for Each Week
**Description:** Identify the top 10 users with the highest total points earned each week.

**Expected Output:** A report showing the top 10 users ranked by total points per week.


 ## Key SQL Concepts Covered
**Aggregation:** Using COUNT, SUM, AVG to aggregate data.

**Date Functions:** Using EXTRACT() and TO_CHAR() for manipulating dates.

**Conditional Aggregation:** Using CASE WHEN to handle positive and negative submissions.

**Ranking:** Using DENSE_RANK() to rank users based on their performance.

**Group By:** Aggregating results by groups (e.g., by user, by day, by week).

 ## SQL Queries Solutions 
 Below are the solutions for each question in this project:

  ## Q.1 List all distinct users and their stats (return user_name, total_submissions, points earned)
``` sql
SELECT
		USERNAME,
		COUNT(ID) AS TOTAL_SUBMISSIONS,
		SUM(POINTS)AS TOTAL_POINTS
FROM USER_SUBMISSIONS
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC

```
